# neuralnilm
Deep Neural Networks Applied to Energy Disaggregation

This is a complete re-write of the
[Neural NILM Prototype](https://github.com/JackKelly/neuralnilm_prototype).

This is 'research' software and will be undergoing a lot of changes
over the coming weeks and months!  Be warned!  Also, my efforts will
be focused on writing code, so I probably won't have time to look at
the issue queue any time soon so please consider this software to
essentially be unsupported for the time being.

# Configuration
You need to create a `~/.neuralnilm` text file to specify some
parameters.  Please see `example_config_file`.
